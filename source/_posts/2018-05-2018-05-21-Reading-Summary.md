Posts I found interesting during my reading:

### [Writing a Time Series Database from Scratch](https://fabxc.org/tsdb/)

The author's experience in writing a time-series database from groundup, for
Prometheus.

### [Introducing Thanos: Prometheus at Scale](https://improbable.io/games/blog/thanos-prometheus-at-scale)

The effort to scale Prometheus with a new project Thanos,
with Kubernetes sidecar pattern, to read
data from individual nodes, pre-process (e.g. sampling), and submit to a
centralized data storage and display.

### [A Beginner's Guide To Scaling To 11 Million+ Users On Amazon's AWS](http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/1/11/a-beginners-guide-to-scaling-to-11-million-users-on-amazons.html)

### [A Usable C++ Dialect that is Safe Against Memory Corruption](http://ithare.com/a-usable-c-dialect-that-is-safe-against-memory-corruption/)

IT-'No Bug'-Hare is an interesting blog I found recently,
focused on system, C++ language and game design. A good read for C++ fanatics
and system designers.

I'm feeling guilty for not updating for so long. But on the bright side: I'm back.

As a part of work requirements I'm taking on Golang and some small
distributed system design jobs. It's an interesting language for this task:
network, systems, infrastructures, etc. I'm having mixed but mostly
positive feelings about this language, and maybe will share my experience
when I got a chance.
