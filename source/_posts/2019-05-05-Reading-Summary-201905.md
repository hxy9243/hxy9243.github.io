TIL that it is possible to convert your C/C++ assembly into Go's assembly, and
call from Go's code. InfluxData leverages the tooling to embed AVX/SSE instructions
into Golang's assembly, thus boosts Go code's performance, sometimes by orders
of magnitude.

More information on this tool, c2goasm, [work from Minio](https://github.com/minio/c2goasm).

## [Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages to Use for Text](https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/)

I think so, too. But it'll require a community and proper tooling to see it
really prosper. Hope to see that some day.
