Posts I found interesting around the web:

### [man7 Linux cgroups](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html)

Linux manual page to cgroups feature in the kernel, which restricts Linux processes CPU, max process numbers, memory usage, network setup and etc..

### [man7 Linux namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)

Linux manual page to namespaces feature in the kernel. Namespaces can be specified by the `clone` syscall, and isolates the child process' cgroup, IPC, network, mount, domain names, and etc..

### [GOTO 2018 Containers From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc)

When all the ingredients come together, it's the foundation where Docker is built upon. This very interesting talk from GOTO2018 demonstrates how you can use the following technologies already built-in the Linux kernel to create your own very small proof-of-concept docker:

- `chroot`
- `namespace`
- `cgroups`

It also includes very interesting details including (but not limited to):

- You'll need to mount the `/proc` virtual file systems for your 'containerized' child process.
- You'll need to provide 'UnshareFlag' `CLONE_NEWNS` to the `clone` system call, to 'unshare' the mount point from the child process from the parent process, so that parent doesn't see child's mount points (which could be many and messy).

### [A Classical Math Problem Gets Pulled Into the Modern World](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-classical-math-problem-gets-pulled-into-the-modern-world-20180523/)

An optimization problem is being used in AI, and therefore all AI applications, including self-driving, etc. Math is magical.

### [Wikipedia is fixing one of Internet's biggest flaws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/25/somethings-terribly-wrong-with-the-internet-and-wikipedia-might-be-able-to-fix-it/?utm_term=.9594628c76ca)

As it actually encourages collaborations, discussions, and exposure to opposing views.

### [Golang Patterns - Part 2](https://dev.to/napicellatwit/golang-patterns---part-2-1906)

### [Technical Writing: Learning from Kernighan](https://two-wrongs.com/technical-writing-learning-from-kernighan.html)

Learning technical writing from the author of your favorite C programming book, 'The C Programming Language'.
