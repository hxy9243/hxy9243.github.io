# C/C++

### [How to find size of an array in C without sizeof](http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/69303442896/the-difference-between-arr-and-arr-how-to-find)

The difference between arr and &arr - basically, arr is of type int *, and &arr is of type (int *)[size].

Very excellent article on the fundamentals of C/C++!

### [What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior](http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html)

Some "gotchas" and pitfalls in the C programming language and how sometimes compiler optimizations can make it worse. Long story short is, steer away from undefined behaviors.

This post is from Chris Lattner himeself. Really nice article.

# Python

### [Python Has Big Impact At Red Hat](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/python-has-big-impact-at-red-hat/)

Why Python is such a cool language and how Python is used in Redhat. Most of redhat's important infrastructure is written in Python, including but not limited to ```firewalld```, ```yum```, and its successor ```dnf```, and many cloud PaaS tools for OpenShift.

(And Death to Python 2!!)

### [Stop Writing Classes - PyCon2012 (Video)](https://youtu.be/o9pEzgHorH0)

Stop writing classes - when, and when not to use classes. Stop thinking in Java (no offense), and learn to be "Pythonic", for a smaller, cleaner, and more well-structured project code base.

# Misc.

### [If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-22/if-you-re-so-smart-why-aren-t-you-rich)

Conscientiousness - "A Personality trait marked by diligence, perseverance and self-discipline".

### [Thinking about thinking](http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21711860-michael-lewis-dissects-enduring-friendship-between-daniel-kahneman-and-amos?fsrc=scn%2Ftw%2Fte%2Fbl%2Fed%2Fthinkingaboutthinking)

Daniel Kahneman - I've been recently reading his book ["Thinking: Fast and Slow"](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/). It's often listed as work in economics, but from what I've read it's also an amazing book on psychology and human cognitives.

Reading more books is definitely one of my New Year resolutions. Just started this book, will finish.
