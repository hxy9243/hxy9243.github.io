### [Alan Kay's Reading List](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp)

If this site is reliable, this is Alan Kay's reading list for all his students. He's a great thinker, not just in Computer Science, but human intelligence in general.

Interestingly how big companies like Facebook and Google use techniques to enchant you to stay on their page for more time, or click on more of their links. I think it's an interesting read that raises our awareness against cases such tricks, and help us defend ourselves from such exploitation.
