# Compiler

### [Reverse Engineering for Beginners](http://beginners.re/)

Or rather, an intro to assembly. I've just took a quick glimpse on the lite version, which is x86/x86_64 MSVC assembly only. A quick review to polish the memories on x86 assembly.

The full version also contains ARM version of assembly, which is my next target.

# Python

### [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

The PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code. A good guide to writing consistently readable and beautiful Python code.

# Miscellaneous

### [OpenPGP for Complete Beginners](http://zacharyvoase.com/2009/08/20/openpgp/)

A good intro to openpgp if you're a beginner or haven't heard of it before.

### [12 resolutions for programmers](http://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/)

An idea list of new year resolutions for programmers. I really like the 'Embrace the uncomfortable' part. Comfort is what kills you - it makes you lazy and dull, and makes your brains decay. It's a good idea to stimulate it once in a while.

I do want to learn at least one more new programming language (or maybe pickup Haskell or/and Scheme again?), learn more about security, learn how to use vim, and learn more about non-programming (economics, philosophy, sociology and etc.?).

### [The Bicycle Problem: How the Illusion of Explanatory Depth Tricks Your Brain](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/12/22/illusion-of-explanatory-depth/)

### [Feynman Technique (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc)

Scott Young explains why we acutally do not understand what we think we understand. And how to really understand by using the 'Feynman Technique'. 

### [Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle](http://www.amazon.com/Start-up-Nation-Israels-Economic-Miracle/dp/0446541478?tag=duckduckgo-d-20)

I've read the Chinese version of this book. Very interesting insight on Israel and Jewish culture. It basically explains how Israel manage to build such a powerful nation and exert influence on global economics, politics, and technology, with limited resources and hostile environment.
